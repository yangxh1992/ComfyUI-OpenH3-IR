/* OpenH3-IR Main: the panel.
 *
 * The node people touch every time was the only one of the four with no surface of its own: one
 * good prompt box sitting on twelve stock widget rows, ungrouped, and with the biggest field on the
 * node unlabelled the moment somebody typed into it. `nodes.py` says so out loud -- "on a multiline
 * widget the placeholder is the only label there is" -- and a placeholder is gone at the first
 * keystroke. The heading `your prompt` is the fix, and it is why this panel earns its place before
 * a single knob is regrouped.
 *
 * Three named groups with one quiet line each, a report line inside the group it talks about, a
 * bottom row for what is rarely touched, and everything that opens floats so the height never
 * jumps.
 *
 * **Rendering only.** The node's real state stays exactly where it is: the same widgets, the same
 * names, the same order, so every saved workflow and every API graph is untouched. They are hidden
 * and driven from here, which is what the Setup node already does with its five file pickers.
 * Delete `web/` and the node still works, still API-drives, and still restores from a save.
 *
 * **The panel owns the prompt textarea rather than borrowing ComfyUI's multiline widget**, because
 * a host widget cannot sit inside a panel and still look like one surface. `prompt.js` survives
 * that unchanged: its picker and its mirror measure their metrics off whatever textarea they are
 * handed, and the mirror only needs to share an offset parent with it, which a sibling always
 * does. The trade has one measured cost, named in AGENTS.md: an installed autocomplete extension
 * that wraps `ComfyWidgets.STRING` binds to the hidden widget rather than to this box.
 *
 * **Nothing here derives a fact about the prompt.** `prompt.js` parses the text and walks the media
 * link, and `promptFacts` hands back what it found. This file only writes the sentences. Two copies
 * of that parse would be two things to keep right.
