/* OpenH3-IR Media: the tray's panel, second construction.
 *
 * The first construction sized itself fluidly against whatever the host gave it, and the host's
 * layout system overrode every declaration: rows painted outside the node at some zooms and inside
 * at others. This one follows the reference loader's principle instead, which the owner spotted:
 * PIN the space for every possible slot beforehand, a fixed 476px board with all nine picture
 * cells, three clip rows and three sound rows drawn from the start, and populate cells as files
 * land. Nothing negotiates for room, so nothing can lose the negotiation.
 *
 * Everything here is rendering. The node's one real field is the `tray` string (JSON slots) and
 * this panel is an editor for it: delete this file and the node still works, still API-drives, and
 * still restores from a saved workflow. The role words and the naming rule MIRROR tray.py,
 * the authority: what it refuses at queue time, the name field here refuses as it is typed, so a
 * tray built on this panel cannot carry a name that would be turned away later.
 *
 * A file lands where it was aimed. Every cell answers a drag itself, so dropping onto a filled one
 * puts that file in its place and keeps the name a prompt already mentions; dropping anywhere else
 * fills the first free cell of that file's own kind, which is the only cell an empty square can
 * mean, because the board draws the slots it has in order and a gap in it is not a thing the tray
 * string can hold. The drag is planned before a byte is sent, and the same plan draws what lights
 * up under the cursor, so the preview cannot promise a landing the release does not make.
 *
 * Board geometry, slot styling and upload idioms follow
 * ComfyUI-Fantastic-MiniMaxH3-PromptBuilder's medialoader.js (MIT), credited in README.md.
