/* OpenH3-IR Setup: the panel.
 *
 * The node holds two things that have nothing to do with each other. A language model somewhere on
 * a network, which writes the brief. Five files on this machine's disk, which render it. As a flat
 * list of widgets nothing said which was which, and the address sat directly above `ref2va` looking
 * like its neighbour. This panel says it: two named groups, each with a quiet line under its
 * heading, and each reporting on its own line inside itself.
 *
 * Everything here is rendering. The node's real state is the ten widgets it already had, and this
 * is an editor for them: delete this file and the node still works, still API-drives, and still
 * restores from a saved workflow, exactly as the media tray and the Director do. The five file
 * pickers are still ComfyUI combo widgets underneath, hidden and driven from a dressed `<select>`,
 * so ComfyUI keeps validating those five values and the widget order never moves.
 *
 * **What this panel adds that a form cannot: it answers back.** The address is the one thing here
 * you cannot pick from a list, and it is the first thing a new user has to get right. So the field
 * takes any address, the caret beside it offers the four programs people actually run and checks
 * each one as the list opens, and the test button reaches the address, lists what it serves, and
 * finds out whether the model it landed on can read a picture.
 *
 * **Every check runs where the compiler runs.** The three routes in `web_api.py` call the
 * compiler's own client from ComfyUI's Python, off the event loop. A fetch straight from this page
 * would test a different machine, hit cross-origin rules the compiler never hits, need the
 * credential in the page, and on a ComfyUI reached over the network it would test the browser's own
 * machine instead. A green light from that proves nothing.
 *
 * **The credential is the one thing here that is not a widget value.** Widget values are written
 * into the saved workflow and into the graph inside every rendered video, and people share
 * workflows by dropping a picture into a chat. The key goes into ComfyUI's own per-user folder
 * instead, beside the Director's saved directions, and the routes read it from there themselves.

 * That works because nothing here reflows. Every quiet line is pinned to the number of rows it needs
 * at 430, the narrowest the node goes, so a wider panel puts the spare row under its own paragraph
 * rather than changing the height. The two report lines are boxes of a fixed number of rows for the
 * same reason, and they are where the room that used to sit above the headings went.
 *
 * Two drafts were wrong before this one, and both are worth knowing. The first split the spare
 * pixels above the two headings, which reads as a hole rather than as air: a heading belongs to the
 * rows under it, and space above one pushes it away from what it heads. The second let the height
 * follow the content, which is tight at every width and makes the node jump when a corner is
 * dragged.
 *
 * The number is measured on the canvas, not reasoned from a table of font metrics. With everything
 * pinned the content comes to 548 at 410, 430, 460, 500 and 520 alike, and no child of the board
