/* OpenH3-IR Director: the panel.
 *
 * The node holds two things — what to call this direction, and the direction itself, written as
 * plain prose. Everything else on this panel exists to fill that second box: picking a director
 * writes its whole text into it, because a preset that selects a name and shows you nothing is a
 * preset you cannot read, edit, or learn from.
 *
 * Everything here is rendering. The node's one real field is the `profile` string (JSON with two
 * keys) and this panel is an editor for it: delete this file and the node still works, still
 * API-drives, and still restores from a saved workflow, exactly as the media tray does. That stays
 * true of the stored directions below — a graph carries the words it was written with, never a
 * pointer to a name, so a workflow opened on a machine that has never seen this store still
 * compiles exactly what you wrote.
 *
 * The seven texts come from ./contract.data.js, which is GENERATED from the compiler's own
 * h3ir/director.py by `h3ir contract --js`. The panel carries a copy because the compiler may be on
 * another machine or not running at all, and a text box that needs a service before it can show you
 * a paragraph is a text box that is empty when you need it. It is generated rather than typed
 * because eleven thousand characters of prose maintained by hand in two languages is drift with a
 * schedule; tests/test_contract_drift.py fails while the copy is stale. Here they are a SEED rather
 * than a menu: the first time the node is opened they are written into the store as ordinary
 * directions, and from then on the list is just what is in the store — no shipped category, nothing
 * that cannot be renamed or deleted.
 *
 * **Where the store is, and why not in the service.** Files in ComfyUI's own per-user folder,
 * `user/default/openh3ir/directors/<name>.json`, through the `/userdata` routes ComfyUI already
 * serves. The compiler's service was the other candidate and it loses on the panel's own rule: it
 * may be on another machine, it may be down, and a list that empties itself exactly when somebody
 * is trying to write in it is the failure this whole file is shaped around. It would also have
 * meant new write routes on a service that binds 0.0.0.0. The cost is stated plainly in the pack's
 * README: a stored direction belongs to this ComfyUI, and a workflow never depends on one.
