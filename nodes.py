"""One node that turns a sentence into a ready-to-sample MiniMax H3 job, one tray that holds
everything the piece looks at or listens to, and one that holds the machine it runs on.

The compile node replaces the text box, the resolution picker, the frame-count arithmetic, the
model, encoder and VAE loaders, and the H3 conditioning node. Out comes the model, the conditioning,
the latent and both VAEs, which is everything the rest of the graph needs.

Five ideas hold it together.

All the media is in one tray, and each slot says what it is. Drop a file, and the choice beside it is
what H3 will be told: a picture that IS the opening frame is a different job from a picture that is
something the shot should contain, and the tray is where that gets said rather than inferred. Every
slot carries a name, and the name is what the prompt refers to it by.

The prompt says where things go. `@carguy walks onto the gantry` names a slot, and
`@speaks("not for me")` locks a line the compiler then enforces word for word. Both are plain text
under whatever the canvas draws, so a graph submitted over the API and a graph typed on the canvas
are the same graph.

Length lives in one place. One seconds field, used for both the brief and the latent. Two dials that
both claim to set the duration is how eight seconds of a ten second script gets rendered.

Which file to load is a question only the user can answer. There is no search by name, no preferred
build and no sentinel that means "work it out": a filename says what a file is called, not what
somebody intended it to be, and a node that answers that question anyway is choosing for the user
without telling them. So the picks are visible on the Setup node, they are trivial to change, and the
report names every file that was loaded and the loader that read it.

The file is the format. A `.gguf` checkpoint or encoder loads through ComfyUI-GGUF's loader and a
`.safetensors` one loads natively, decided per file from the extension, with no toggle anywhere. A
boolean beside a filename would be two controls describing one fact, and two of its four states
would be wrong with nothing on the canvas to resolve them.

This uses ComfyUI's current node schema, the same one the stock H3 nodes use, so any ComfyUI that can
render H3 can load this. Heavy imports stay inside the functions that need them: an exception while
ComfyUI imports a custom node takes the whole pack off the menu with a traceback nobody can act on.

The panel on the tray and the chips in the prompt are drawn by `web/`, and they are decoration in the
strict sense: delete that folder and both nodes still work, still import, still API-drive, and still
restore from a saved workflow. The tray is JSON in a widget and the prompt is plain text in a widget,
and those two strings are the whole contract.

    A picker, and only a picker. Every combo lists the files this install actually has, in both
    formats, and opens on one of them the way ComfyUI's own loaders do. Nothing is searched for by
    name, no build is preferred, and there is no option meaning "work it out": which of two H3
    checkpoints somebody meant is not written in either filename, so the answer belongs to the person
    who put the files there. The pick is on the canvas where it can be read and changed, and the
    compile node's report names every file it loaded.

    **The compiler runs here unless this node says otherwise**, which is what makes the pack an
    all-in-one: nothing to start, no port, no second process. `server` empty means the `open-h3-ir`
    installed in the Python ComfyUI is running. An address in it means a service at that address
    instead, for a compile on another machine, and that path is not the poor relation -- it produces
    the same brief from the same graph.

    **The language model address lives on this node because there is nowhere else left to put it.**
    The compiler writes the brief by asking an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and that used to be an
    environment variable set on a service nobody starts any more. `H3IR_LLM_URL` still works for
    somebody who sets it before ComfyUI starts, and the report says when a value came from there
    rather than from this node, because a setting nobody can see on the canvas has to be said out
    loud somewhere.

    **The two new fields are last on purpose.** ComfyUI saves a node's widget values as a positional
    list -- measured on a saved workflow from this install, not assumed -- so a field inserted in the
    middle of this schema silently shifts every value after it in every workflow anybody has saved.
    New fields go on the end. The panel in `web/` lays them out however it likes; the order here is
    what the canvas falls back to and what the saved file depends on.

    there if the user wants to steer, makes room for the other controls like saving the profiles and
    such." Most graphs never want direction, and a permanent row on the busiest node in the pack is
    a row everybody reads and almost nobody uses. Absent, it costs nothing; present, it has room for
    a paragraph.

    It also settles a question a combo on Main could not. There is exactly ONE place direction is
    written -- this node -- so there is no second dial to disagree with, which is the same fault as
    two widgets both claiming to set the duration. Unplug it and nothing steers; that is not a third
    state, it is the absence of the only one. There is no `none` on it for the same reason: the node
    IS the choice.

    **Two fields, and both of them are yours.** What to call this direction, and the direction
    itself. The seven directors the panel offers are not a menu that selects something invisible --
    each one writes its whole text into the box, where you can read it, change a line, or throw half
    of it away. A preset that shows you nothing is a preset you cannot learn from.

    **What direction reaches, and what it never does.** It fills what your sentence and your
    references leave open, and the compiler places it under a licence block that has already said in
    computed terms which attributes your own words took. It never sets how many shots there are or
    where they cut: pin `shots` on Main and the count is your contract, enforced; leave it on `auto`
    and the writer decides the edit, the way `auto` has always meant.

    **Everything typed here is a widget value**, so it is already kept in a saved workflow and in a
    rendered video's embedded graph, exactly as the media tray is: drag that mp4 back in and the
    direction comes with it. The panel's **save** and **forget** keep a copy in ComfyUI's own user
    folder, `user/default/openh3ir/directors/`, so a direction written here can be picked again in
    another graph. That store is a convenience and never a dependency: a graph carries the words it
    was written with rather than a pointer to a name, so this node compiles the same thing on a
